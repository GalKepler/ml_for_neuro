# Syllabus

The primary objective of this course is to familiarize neuroscience students with the techniques and practical uses of Machine Learning (ML) within the field.

We will illustrate all practical aspects of the course through hands-on examples and applications, all of which will be showcased using the Python programming language.

**Prerequisites:**

1. Basic knowledge of programming.
2. Extended Mathematics course (in the Life Sciences faculty), or a parallel one.

**Python Workshop:**

All your assignments need to be done in Python.

If Python isn't your strong suit, don't worry, we've got you covered in the first few weeks.

Check out our [self-assessment exam](https://moodle.tau.ac.il/mod/resource/view.php?id=136694) on the course website to see where you stand with Python.
We've also got Python workshop videos ([Video 1](https://tau.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=35b083a3-8a5f-46f1-99ad-ac6200b1525d) and [Video 2](https://tau.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1af6fe4c-c586-4e2c-8ea4-ac6900afd9eb)) that pretty much cover what you'd find in the first 5 chapters of the ["Python for Neuroscientists"](<(https://sagol-python-for-neuroscientists.github.io/textbook-public/intro.html)>) course.

**We kindly request that students who aren't familiar with Python complete the workshop to get up to speed.**
