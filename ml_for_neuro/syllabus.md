# Syllabus of Machine Learning for Neuroscientists

The primary objective of this course is to familiarize neuroscience students with the techniques and practical uses of Machine Learning (ML) within the field.
We will illustrate all practical aspects of the course through hands-on examples and applications, all of which will be showcased using the Python programming language.

__Prerequisites:__

1. Basic knowledge of programming.
2. Extended Mathematics course (in the Life Sciences faculty), or a parallel one.

__Python Workshop:__

All assignments must be submitted in Python. Students who are not familiar with the Python programming language must bridge the gap over the first few weeks of the course.
To assess your familiarity with Python, a self-assesment exam is provided in the course's website.
The Python workshop is available for you via the following videos: [video 1](https://tau.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=35b083a3-8a5f-46f1-99ad-ac6200b1525d), [video 2](https://tau.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1af6fe4c-c586-4e2c-8ea4-ac6900afd9eb).
These videos cover most of the material available in the [Python for Neuroscientists course](https://sagol-python-for-neuroscientists.github.io/textbook-public/intro.html).

__Final Grade Components:__

10% - Homework Assignments (80% completion required, submitted in pairs)
90% - Final Project (Quality and completion assessment)
